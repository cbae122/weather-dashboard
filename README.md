# weather-dashboard

## Description
- Motivation to build a weather dashboard was based on the past couple of classes. Classes were taught on Javascript, JQuery, bootstrap, and API calling functions. Combined you can create apps and website needed to fill the consumers needs.
- I built the weather dashboard to take what I've learned these past couple of days during bootcamp. We learned that we can have Javascript call a function and execute said function to make a tool based on the needs a person might have. Also implemented JQuery and using DAYJS to add dates without having to create the function for it. We also learned how to access web API's to pull information to build our own websites.
- This project solves the problem if you need to know the current weather and 5 day forecast for any city you may potenetially want to visit!
- I learned that Javascript and JQuery allows your website/tool to function. It takes your variables and applies them to functions and executes the functions based on your needs which is defined in the if and else if statements.
